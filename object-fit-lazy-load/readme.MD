# OBJECT FIT is the perfect option to replace background-image for performance.

If you use background-image, it will is not able to lazyload natively. You will see yourself in a situation to use a lazy library just for that. \
Instead, we have a great solution to replace background-image to object fit img tag.

>Don't forget to use the lazyloading only outside your [LCP](https://web.dev/lcp/) - of course.
